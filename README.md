# Japan Inbound Tourism Data Analysis

## Executive Summary
Tourism in Japan has been on the rise for various reasons. As Japan reopens its borders, understanding who spends, how much, and why has never been more critical. This project dives deep into over a decade of inbound tourism data, analyzing 125,000+ data points across 17 countries and ¥5B+ in tourist spending by focusing on two core dimensions:
 
1. **Total Spending by Country**: Understand which markets contribute the most in absolute monetary terms.
2. **Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth Rate**: Identify emerging or declining tourist markets based on annual changes.

Note: Data for the years 2020 to 2022 is unavailable due to limited public reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Japan closed its borders to international tourists.

## Insights Deep-Dive

### Tourism Trends and Growth Rates
- In 2024, Russia (+199.3%) and China (+148.7%) recorded the highest YOY tourism growth, signaling explosive post-COVID demand.
- 17 out of 18 listed countries experienced positive growth in 2024, reflecting a widespread global recovery.
- Growth was especially strong from Asia-Pacific markets, reinforcing Japan’s regional tourism appeal.
- Tourism growth in 2024 far outpaced pre-COVID years, with many countries doubling their 2019 rates.

### Tourism Rebound Mirrors Policy Changes
- The dramatic spike in 2024 growth for countries like Russia (199.3%) and China (148.7%) likely reflects the reopening after prolonged border closures, eased travel restrictions, and strong domestic promotion campaigns post-COVID.
- These jumps suggest that government policy is one of the most powerful levers for tourism recovery.

### Volatility = Vulnerability/Opportunity
- Indonesia, Taiwan, and Italy show wild swings: sharp declines in 2019 followed by massive rebounds in 2024.
- This kind of volatility often suggests dependence on specific tourism channels.
- While the rebound looks promising, the inconsistency is a risk factor — Japan must work to diversify tourism sources to avoid being vulnerable to shocks.
### Downward Trends
- The UK had a negative growth rate of -2.4% in 2016, but steadily recovered, reaching 58.4% in 2024, which might reflect a renewed interest post-Brexit.
- Negative growth rates can be associated with various reasons, such as policy changes within a country, and not necessarily a weakness in Japan's tourism promotion plan.

### Total Spending Over Time
- China consistently leads in tourism spending even during its steep drop in 2019 during the COVID period, with a sharp bounce back of 148.7% in 2024.
- Sharp rebounds in 2023 and 2024 show the sector's resilience, with 2024 surpassing pre-COVID levels.
- China is one of the few countries recording a significant drop in tourists in 2023 compared to 2019 caused by its traveling policies following COVID-19, showcasing its major role in influencing tourism trends.
- China, Taiwan, and the United States contribute to over 42.7% of Japan's international tourism spending.
## Recommendations
### Enhancing Tourist Retention
- **Returning Tourists**: Japan might experience a drop in tourism from countries that have reached its tourism ceiling. To maintain peak tourism levels, efforts must shift to focusing on encouraging returning visitors with enhanced experiences and long-term engagement strategies.
- **Introduce Loyalty Programs**: Implement a tourism loyalty scheme such as discounts, free experience, or VIP passes to incentivize returning visitors.

### Market Expansion
- **Diversification**: Japan's inbound tourism currently relies heavily on countries like China and the US. Fast-growing Southeast Asian and European markets like Spain, India, and Italy offer diversification potential.
- **Promote Local Culture and Sustainability**: Develop authentic local experiences in less popular cities to attract culturally curious and responsible travelers.
